# SpaceShooter
Our first game, SpaceShooter, is a simple game where you control a spaceship and shoot down enemies. 
The game is written in C++, using standart libraries and OpenGl. 
For compilation was used MSVC with Cmake.

The game is available for both Windows and Linux.
> The game was tested on Windows 11 & 10, Kali-linux, using WSL.

## How to play
The game is controlled by keyboard and mouse.

- **Right mouse button** - use special ability
- **ctrl** - move ship down
- **space** - move ship up

## Realised c++ capabilities by Egor
- **Templates** - were used templates to achieve reusable code in two functions, to read data from .txt file with n-words in an array and to make function work with different objects of render type.
- **OOP** - inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism were used, with help of virtual and pure virtual methods and classes
- **Patterns** - singleton and stategy patterns were used
- **Multi-threding** - render is being proccessed in another thread
- **external library** - OpenGL is used
- **CMake** - CMake was used to build project
- **exceptions** - you may find all over the code part which are being run in try and some exceptions are being thrown.
- **etc...**
